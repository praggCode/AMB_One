# üöë Ambulance Booking System ‚Äì Backend

The **Ambulance Booking System** backend powers a real-time ambulance booking platform that connects patients (clients) with nearby ambulance drivers.  
Inspired by Uber‚Äôs model, this system is specialized for **medical emergencies**, enabling **quick ambulance booking**, **real-time tracking**, and **secure authentication** for both drivers and clients.

---

## üß† Overview

The backend is built using **Node.js (Express.js)** with **MongoDB** as the database and **Socket.io** for real-time communication.  
It provides APIs for:
- OTP-based authentication (for clients)
- Email-password login (for drivers)
- Ambulance booking, tracking, and status updates
- Communication between client and driver in real time

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

### üîê Authentication System
- **Client Authentication (OTP-based)** using Firebase or Twilio
  - Clients log in using their mobile number
  - OTP is sent via Firebase Authentication
  - Once verified, a JWT is issued for session management  
- **Driver Authentication (Email + Password)**
  - Drivers register and log in using secure credentials
  - Passwords are hashed using **bcrypt**
  - JWTs are used for authentication and route protection
